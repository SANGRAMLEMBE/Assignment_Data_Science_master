    "to define, manipulate, and query relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Schema: \n",

    "relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table-based: \n",
    "Data in SQL databases is stored in tables with rows and columns, and the \n",
    "relationships between different tables are defined using primary keys and \n",
    "foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Transactions: \n",
    "SQL databases generally support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, \n",
    "Durability) transactions, ensuring data integrity and reliability even in the \n",
    "event of failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite.\n",

    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational: \n",
    "NoSQL databases, as the name implies, do not follow the traditional relational \n",
    "model. They are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and \n",
    "offer more flexible data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema flexibility: \n",
    "NoSQL databases allow for dynamic schema changes, meaning different records in \n",
    "the same collection can have different fields, which makes them ideal for \n",
    "rapidly evolving and diverse data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document, Key-Value, Column-family, or Graph-based: \n",

    "\n",
    "Non-null: A primary key column cannot contain NULL values. Every record must \n",

    "Irreducibility: The primary key must be minimal and cannot be divided further \n",
