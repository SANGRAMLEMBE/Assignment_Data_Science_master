    "#Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Data abstraction in programming refers to the process of hiding internal \n",
    "implementation details of data structures or objects and providing a simplified \n",
    "and consistent interface for interacting with the data. \n",
    "Here's how data abstraction can be achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: \n",
    "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in achieving data abstraction. It \n",
    "involves bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single \n",
    "unit (e.g., a class). By making the data private and exposing only necessary \n",
    "methods or properties, you can control access to the internal state of the \n",
    "object and enforce data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Modifiers: \n",
    "Programming languages often provide access modifiers (e.g., public, private, \n",
    "protected) to restrict access to data members and methods. By marking internal \n",
    "data as private and exposing only the essential methods or properties as public,\n",
    "you establish an abstraction layer that hides the implementation details and \n",
    "allows interaction with the data through a controlled interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Data Types (ADTs): \n",
    "Abstract data types provide a high-level description of data and operations on \n",
    "that data without specifying the implementation details. ADTs define the \n",
    "behavior and properties of the data structure without exposing the underlying \n",
    "implementation. For example, a stack ADT specifies the push, pop, and peek \n",
    "operations without revealing how the stack is actually implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces and Contracts: \n",
    "Interfaces define a set of methods that a class must implement, without \n",
    "specifying the implementation itself. By programming to interfaces, you can \n",
    "achieve data abstraction by interacting with objects based on their interface \n",
    "rather than their specific implementation. Contracts establish a set of rules \n",
    "and expectations for classes implementing an interface, ensuring consistency \n",
    "and providing a clear abstraction layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these techniques, you can achieve data abstraction by hiding \n",
    "internal implementation details, exposing only necessary methods or properties, \n",
    "and providing a simplified and consistent interface for interacting with the \n",
    "data or objects. This promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier \n",
